# JavaFX-Frogger

# How to play 
Press the "W" key to move the frog up
Press the "A" key to move the frog to the left 
Press the "S" key to move the frog down
Press the "D" key to move the frog to the right

When the frog is hit by a vehicle or falls into the river it will go back to the start
The frog can also be reset if the frog jumps inaccurately towards the lily pad or jumps into a lily pad that is already occupied by another frog 
The goal is to get 5 frogs to the lily pads at the end of the screen without letting the frogs die along the way
When that objective is completed the frogs will be reset leaving the player to complete the objective once again
